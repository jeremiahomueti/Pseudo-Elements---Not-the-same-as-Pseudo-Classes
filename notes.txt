These are almost like pseudo classes, 
but they select a particular part of the selected elements. 

They are no where near as many as Pseudo classes - there are 
only a handful of them. 


Unlike pseudo classes that has use a single column,

Pseudo elements use two columns.

Pseudo classes are a state - whereas pseudo elements are 
a thing or specific selected item.
